# Internship experience and IIT collaboration
During this experience we have gained new knowledge in the IT and personal fields.

We were able to create a great team to work with, each of us committed and completed their tasks to the fullest of his abilities.    
We all tried to collaborate with each other so that the work was as orderly and cohesive as possible, so we always worked closely with each other. 

We liked this experience because we add the opportunity to use our creativity for developing a project that can help many people with multiple sclerosis to do the rehab excercise.

Most of all we will thank the IIT of Genova for the opportunity and the help given to us.
