# Things we learned

During this project we had to find, test and learn new libraries and technologies.

We have all deepened our knowledge of **Python** and **Git**, besides that we have learned to use different libraries useful for development.

In addition to the notions of programming, we also had to learn how to manage a **graphic project** to create customized backgrounds and sprites according to our needs. 

We have also learn to respect deadline and to write scalable code readable by others.
